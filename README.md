# ConsumingGenericInterfaceCppCLI
Consuming a generic interface of another assembly (aka managed library) in c++CLI definition of an reference class

Hey, I thought i did i right but i didn't if you come over the side with the internet missing the right hint!

If Visual Studio tells you

Error	C3225	generic type argument for 't' cannot be 'Foo', it must be a value type or a handle to a reference type	


The add an ___ ^ ___ to the type!


not Foo it's Foo^ an total beginners failure :) You are welcome
 and give me an Star for the joke on my cost
